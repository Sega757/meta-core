# Architecture Decision Records

Each ADR documents one trade-off point in the META-CORE design: the
conflict that forced a choice, the alternatives considered, and why one was
picked. They follow a lightweight format: **Context → Decision →
Alternatives & trade-offs → Consequences**.

The first ten share a single recurring theme: wherever a performance or
convenience win required trusting the Reasoning Plane with more access, the
decision instead pays an isolation or latency cost to keep that plane
untrusted. ADRs 0011–0015 harden specific mechanisms that were previously
left as open questions — loop detection, spend control, data provenance,
context assembly, and trace diagnosability — without changing that
underlying trust boundary. See
[`docs/architecture/overview.md`](../architecture/overview.md) for how these
decisions compose into the full system.
